This is an automated script run by GitHub Action, aiming to download and trim these blocklists:
- AIP-Alpha7-latest.csv (https://mcfp.felk.cvut.cz/publicDatasets/CTU-AIPP-BlackList/Latest/)
- Spamhaus IP Blocklist (https://www.spamhaus.org/drop/drop.txt)
- DShield IP Blocklist (https://www.dshield.org/block.txt)
so that they can be used in Skynet for AsusMerlin routers.

All credits go to user: UoFruitE (https://github.com/UoFruitE) for the idea and the Java scripts.
